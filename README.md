# BuildingChatbot
Building a chatbot in Python involves using libraries such as NLTK or ChatterBot to process and understand user inputs, and generate appropriate responses. The chatbot can be designed to handle specific tasks, answer queries, or engage in general conversation by leveraging natural language processing techniques and pre-defined response patterns.
